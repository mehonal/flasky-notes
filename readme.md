# About

Basic noting app built with a Flask backend.

# Philosophy

The noting app aims to provide simple, fast and bloat-free noting with clean interface options.

# Themes

## Paper

The Paper theme has options provided via GUI and does not rely on keyboard shortcuts. It's the default theme and aims to be easy to use for the average user.

## Full

The Full theme features a fullscreen keyboard-shortcut intensive approach to noting. It's aimed to provide a swift and content-focused experience.

# How to deploy

Currently all the Python code is packed in app.py.

The `serve_live.py` file uses waitress to serve the web app. Alternatively, you can serve it using `serve_local.py` to serve it on localhost

# Future Goals

- Add Support for Encryption
- Add Note Sharing with public links
- Improve Design
